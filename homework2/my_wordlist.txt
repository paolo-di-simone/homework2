endocarditis
of
her

At

Bacterial
meningitis
in
the
United
States
1986:
report
of
a
multistate
surveillance
study
The
Bacterial
Meningitis
Study
Group
A
prospective
laboratory-based
surveillance
project
obtained
accurate
data
on
meningitis
in
a
population
of
34
million
people
during
1986
Haemophilus
influenzae
was
the
most
common
cause
of
bacterial
meningitis
followed
by
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
and
Neisseria
meningitidis
Rates
of
H
influenzae
meningitis
varied
significantly
by
region
from
in
New
Jersey
to
in
Washington
state
The
overall
case
fatality
rates
for
meningitis
were
lower
than
those
reported
in
several
studies
from
the
early
1970s
suggesting
that
improvements
in
early
detection
and
antibiotic
treatment
may
have
occurred
since
that
time
Concurrent
surveillance
was
also
performed
for
all
invasive
disease
due
to
the
five
most
common
causes
of
bacterial
meningitis
Serotypes

B
streptococcus

type

B
streptococcal
disease

suggesting
that
an
optimal
vaccine
preparation
must
be
multivalent
Of
the

group
B
streptococcus
was
the
second
most
